# Translate Chat diagnosis — 2026-08-22

- Preview copy opened at `/studych` with an empty local session.
- A live chat prompt, `Halo, jelaskan singkat apa itu cloud storage.`, used the displayed provider `StudyOS AI gateway · GPT-5 mini` while processing but ended with `Respons AI belum bisa diproses. Coba kirim ulang atau periksa AI Settings.`
- Because no successful assistant response was returned, translation could not yet be exercised on this fresh preview. The evidence indicates provider availability needs checking before treating this as a client-only translation parser issue.
- User screenshot shows Translate Chat preserving originals and presenting the message that translation is unavailable; exact server request evidence remains to be collected from fresh logs.
- The copied preview retained the original user bubble after the failed chat request, and the bottom Source-panel Translate control could be activated against that message after the UI update.
- A browser automation click did not persist the local translation mode in the preview, so the server request was additionally verified directly. This does not alter the confirmed backend response classification, but the UI action needs an explicit event-level check.
- Direct UI-event verification produced the new quota-specific alert, restored the translation toggle to `false`, retained the original text, and kept the retry action available.
